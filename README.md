# Data-Visualisation-Hackathon
This repository contain's our team's submission to the CANIS Data Visualization and Foreign Interference Hackathon.

# Data
This project uses the CANIS_PRC_state_media_on_social_media_platforms dataset.

# Overview
Our goal was to showcase the scale of China's social media prescence. We did this by analysing the 4 largest parent entities in the dataset(Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Central Publicity Department, State Council, Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party) and creating a regional breakdown.

In our project, we added together the social media followers of various actors assocaiated with each of these entities and plotted them using the "pandas" and "matplotlib" libraries

# Usage
The plot_entity_regions.py file is used for plotting the regional breakdown for a given parent entity from the dataset. Run the file and input an entity to see the results
